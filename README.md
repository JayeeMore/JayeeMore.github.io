    <h2>THE STORY OF ME AND JUNJI</h2>
    <h5>Junji is my cat that i love very much although he poops anywhere but his litter box :></h5>
    <div><img src="junji the catto.png" style="height:400px; width: 1000px;"></div>
    <h2>Backstory</h2>
<p style="font-size: 120%; font-family: 'Tahoma', sans-serif;">I adopted Junji when he was a baby, his mother was my first pet during the pandemic but sadly we had to move out.
    A month before that, Lucy (Junji's Mother) gave birth to 4 kittens, namely Momo, Kiyoko, Daiyan, and Junji. I took care of them for a while and moved out with them carrying them inside a box since i don't have a pet carrier yet. When we moved out to the new place, Lucy ran away just being there in the first place, she probably felt really traumatized because of the move because she really didn't like cars. So i was left 4 kittens, these 4 kittens are the most adorable thing i've ever seen in my entire life like, look at them.</p>
    <br><div><img src="boxcat.png" class="center" style="height: 300px; width: 300px;"></br></div>
<br><p style="font-size:120%; font-family: 'Tahoma', sans-serif;">When my family and I decided to relocate to Lapu-Lapu City, we packed our belongings and departed during the entire process. Lucy regrettably went away shortly after we moved in, perhaps because she wasn't feeling well from the travel or she felt too nervous or overwhelmed by the setting she was placed in, so she fled and never returned. I still feel terrible for Lucy and wish I hadn't put her in that situation. Despite this, I remained optimistic and promised myself and Lucy that I would take care of her kittens and allow them to grow up to be healthy and strong. I felt like a mother taking care of a baby for weeks as I provided them food, drink, and showers at the appropriate age. I was lucky since I didn't have courses and it was summer vacation, so I could actually keep an eye on the cats.</p></br>
<div><img src="cats.png" class="center" style="height: 500px; width: 1000px;"></div>
<br><p style="font-size:120%; font-family: 'Tahoma', sans-serif;">Months pass and the cats have matured into more like toddlers; my friends wanted cats, so I gave them two of my cats, Daiyan and Kiyoko, because they are a little loud in the house and I don't want to disturb the neighbors every day; at the very least, I gave them away to good friends, so I know they are in good hands. So Junji and Momo are left with me; I began caring for them, but I noticed that Momo is losing weight and not developing, although Junji is healthy and always active. I became really concerned when she couldn't gain weight and only ate small amounts at a time, and she was usually weary. Unfortunately, she died, and I cried a lot. May Momo rest in peace; she will be missed and I trust the cat god will look after her.
</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:120%; font-family: 'Tahoma', sans-serif;">So that's how I ended up with Junji, a very hyper, loud, energetic cat that loves to play and poop everywhere. Although he has been a trouble maker, he  has always been there with me by my side no matter how much room he takes up in my bed, he is always welcome to sleep with me. There are times where I would have emotional breakdowns and I know that Junji could sense it so he would always come to my side and comfort me. He is my comfort pet and my side kick whenever I am at my lowest, he is like my best friend whenever I feel alone and he knows when I need him and I am very happy with him.</p>
